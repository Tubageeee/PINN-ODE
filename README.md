This repository documents my learning journey with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), an area that greatly interests me. 
I aim to apply this knowledge to research in Partial Differential Equations (PDE), particularly within the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 
I will be uploading PINN demonstrations that I have learned to this repository. Please stay tuned for updates.
Open to any comments, suggestions, questions, etc.
